/*
Problem:
Write a React component that displays a list of items with a form for adding new items to the list. The user should be able to add new items to the list by entering text into the form and submitting it.

Example:
If the list of items is initially empty, and the user enters 'apple' into the form and submits it, the component should display the list ['apple'].

import your component into src/App.tsx and render it.

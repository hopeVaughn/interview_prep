/*
Sure, here's a small coding exercise that involves React and TypeScript:

Problem:
Write a React component that displays a countdown timer that starts at a given number of seconds and counts down to zero. When the timer reaches zero, the component should display a message.

Example:
If the starting time is 10 seconds, the timer should display:
10
9
8
...
1
0
(message: Time's up!)

Import your component into src/App.tsx and render it with the startTime prop set to 10. Try changing the startTime prop to a different number and see what happens.

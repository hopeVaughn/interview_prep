/**
Problem:
Given an array of strings, write a React component that renders a list of buttons, where each button displays one of the strings from the array. When a button is clicked, an alert should be displayed that shows the corresponding string from the array.
 */

/*
Example:

const strings = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

When the user clicks the 'banana' button, an alert should be displayed with the text 'banana'.

Import your component into src/App.tsx and render it with the strings array as its props.

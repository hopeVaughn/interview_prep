/*
Problem:
Write a React component that displays a form with a file upload input. When a file is selected and uploaded, the component should display the file name and size.

Example:
If the user selects a file called 'example.txt' with a size of 2.5 MB,
the component should display the following:
Name: example.txt
Size: 2.5 MB

Import your component into src/App.tsx and render it.

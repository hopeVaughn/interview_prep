/*
Problem:
Write a React component that displays a form with two input fields, one for a username and one for a password. When the form is submitted, the component should log the values of the username and password fields to the console.

Example:
If the user enters the username 'johndoe' and the password 'secret' and submits the form,
the component should log the following to the console:
username: johndoe
password: secret

Import your component into src/App.tsx and render it.

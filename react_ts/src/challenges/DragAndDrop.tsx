/*
Problem:
Write a React component that displays a list of items that can be sorted by dragging and dropping. The user should be able to drag an item and drop it at a different position in the list. When an item is dropped, the component should update the list to reflect the new order.

Example:
If the list of items is initially ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'],
the component should display the following list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

The user can then drag 'Item 3' and drop it between 'Item 1' and 'Item 2',
and the component should display the following list:

- Item 3
- Item 1
- Item 2

Import your component into src/App.tsx and render it.

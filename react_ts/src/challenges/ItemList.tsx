/*
Problem
Write a React component that displays a search bar and a list of items. The search bar should filter the list of items based on the user's input. The component should also display a message when there are no matching items.

Example

const items = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'];

If the user types 'a' in the search bar, the list of items should display:
- apple
- banana

If the user types 'z' in the search bar, the list of items should display:
- (message: No matching items found)

Import your component into src/App.tsx and render it with the strings array as its props.

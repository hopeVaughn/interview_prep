/*
Problem:
Write a React component that displays a list of items with a search bar. When the user types a search query into the search bar, the component should filter the list of items to show only those that match the query.

Example:
If the list of items is ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'],
and the user types 'a' into the search bar,
the component should display the filtered list ['apple', 'banana'].

Import your component into src/App.tsx and render it.

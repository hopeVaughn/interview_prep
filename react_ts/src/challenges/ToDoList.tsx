/*
Problem:
Write a React component that displays a simple todo list with the ability to add and remove items from the list. The list should be styled using Tailwind CSS to be completely responsive to small, medium, and large screens.

Example:
If the list of items is initially empty, and the user adds 'Buy milk' and 'Do laundry' to the list, the component should display the following list:

- Buy milk
- Do laundry

The user can then remove 'Buy milk' from the list,
and the component should display the following list:

- Do laundry

Import your component into src/App.tsx and render it.

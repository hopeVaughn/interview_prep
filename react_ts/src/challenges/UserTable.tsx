/*
Problem:
You are given an array of objects representing users. Each user has a name, age, and gender property. Write a React component that displays a list of users in a table, where each row displays the user's name, age, and gender. The table should be sortable by each column (i.e., by name, age, and gender).

Example:
const users = [
  { name: 'Alice', age: 25, gender: 'female' },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 30, gender: 'male' },
  { name: 'Charlie', age: 20, gender: 'male' },
  { name: 'Danielle', age: 35, gender: 'female' },
];

The table should display the users in the following order:
Alice | 25 | female
Bob | 30 | male
Charlie | 20 | male
Danielle | 35 | female

Import your component into src/App.tsx and render it with the users array as its props.

/*
Problem:
Write a React component that displays a timer that counts up from zero. The user should be able to start, pause, and reset the timer.

Example:
If the user starts the timer, waits for 3 seconds, pauses the timer, waits for 2 seconds,
and resets the timer, the component should display the following times:
0:00
0:03
0:03 (when the timer is paused)
0:03 (when the timer is reset)

Import your component into src/App.tsx and render it.
